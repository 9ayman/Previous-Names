# Discord Prev Names Bot

This is a simple Discord bot that tracks the previous usernames of users in your server. Whenever a user changes their nickname, the bot will automatically save their previous nickname along with the timestamp of the change. You can then use a command to retrieve the list of previous nicknames for a particular user.

## Features

- Tracks the previous usernames of users in a Discord server
- Saves the old usernames in a database (QuickDB)
- Displays the old usernames in a paginated embed when requested by a user
- Provides a button interface to navigate between pages of old usernames
- Can clear old usernames for a user
- Configurable with a JSON file (config.json)
- Built using Node.js and the devland.js and QuickDB libraries

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install Node.js (if not already installed) from https://nodejs.org/en/
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the downloaded repository.
4. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
5. Rename `config.example.json` to `config.json`.
6. Open `config.json` and replace the `token` field with your Discord bot token. You can obtain a bot token from the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications).
7. (Optional) Modify the other fields in `config.json` as desired. You can change the bot prefix, the color of the embeds, and whether or not users are allowed to clear their previous nicknames.
8. Run `npm start` to start the bot.

## Usage

### The bot responds to the following command:
;prev <@user> - Replace `<@user>` with the user whose previous nicknames you want to view or leave it blank. If the user has changed their nickname in the past, the bot will respond with an embed showing their previous nicknames and the dates they were changed.

### To clear your own previous nicknames, use the following command:
;prev clear - If the bot is configured to allow users to clear their previous nicknames, this will delete all previously saved nicknames for the user.
